<div class="section" id="scala-multiple-installation-support">
<h2>Scala Multiple Installation Support</h2>
<p>Scala IDE now supports projects set up for several major versions of the
Scala compiler.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-multiple-versions">
<h3>Why multiple versions ?</h3>
<p>The Scala IDE has a strong dependency on Scala&nbsp;: it comes deeply
embedded with an interactive version of the compiler, called the
<a class="reference external" href="./dev/architecture/presentation-compiler.html#scalapresentationcompiler">Presentation Compiler</a>, that it uses to do all the interactive
work on your code: completions, errors as you type, semantic
highlighting, etc <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>So far the Scala IDE was therefore built <em>on</em> and <em>for</em> a
specific version of the Scala Compiler. For editing 2.10
projects, you had to have a version of the IDE compiled for
Scala 2.10. For 2.11, you had to have a version compiled for
Scala 2.11. This led to users working with both 2.11 and 2.10
projects to have two installations of Eclipse, with different
flavors of the Scala IDE plugin installed.</p>
<p>This also constrained us developers: since most of the IDE&#8217;s
source code had to pass compilation with both 2.10 and 2.11, it
was impossible to remove some obsolete things, led to some
regression headaches, and made us maintain two parallel branches
for the source.</p>
<p>With this multi-version support feature, we want to use a single
version of the IDE, built on the latest version of Scala, to
handle both &#8220;modern&#8221; projects built using 2.11, as well as &#8220;legacy&#8221;
projects built with 2.10.</p>
<p>It will also let us retire the 2.10 branch of the IDE builds,
focusing the efforts of our small team on one branch, and
letting us deliver features to our users faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scala-multi-version-support">
<h3>Scala Multi Version Support</h3>
<p>The gist of it is the following: the IDE is, as of its 4.0.0 release, a
2.11 build. The Presentation Compiler it ships with is a part of Scala
2.11. But its typechecker can run with a specific option,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Xsource:2.10</span></code> that lets it work on 2.10 source files. That&#8217;s now a
standalone <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.1">scala compiler</a> option,
by the way — though please note it only affects up to the typechecker
phase <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you are working on a 2.11 project, nothing changed — this
is business as usual. If you are working on a 2.10 code base, a
few tweaks and settings may be needed, though the IDE will try
to help you.</p>
<p>All you may need to do, then, is to tell the IDE how to deal with
your Scala 2.10 project. For that you need to align a few things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a setting of compiler options</li>
<li>a consistent classpath</li>
<li>in particular, a compatible Scala classpath container within it</li>
<li>and optionally, a custom Scala Installation</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is brought to you by a single toggle, that we will
deal with first, so that those of you in a hurry can start
hacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-level">
<h3>Source Level</h3>
<p>To configure a new, fresh project for 2.10 compatibility, you have to
go to project-specific settings: the platform&#8217;s default is still
to consider that projects are based on Scala 2.11 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll see:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/compiler-before.png"><img alt="img1" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/compiler-before.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>You can now toggle project-specific settings and look at the
drop-down just below it. It displays a list of versioned Scala
installations that should include (at least) both a 2.10 version
and a 2.11 version. Some are labeled as <em>dynamic</em>, others as
<em>fixed</em>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/compiler-toggled.png"><img alt="img2" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/compiler-toggled.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>The meaning of a fixed version is just that: if you select any
fixed version, your project will be type-checked with that
particular version of Scala, for as long as the IDE can find it <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>The meaning of a dynamic option is that it will get updated in a
binary compatible way as we ship updates of the IDE through
Eclipse <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_upgrade_Eclipse%253F">update sites</a>. You have the insurance that if you choose
a dynamic 2.11 version, what will be used is the latest
available 2.11 installation the IDE ships with <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s it</strong>&nbsp;! Now once you select one of these options
(hopefully a
2.10 installation, since this is what we&#8217;re here to do), you
will not see any changes to other compilation options. But if
you subsequently reopen compiler settings for that project,
you&#8217;ll see that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Xsource:2.10</span> <span class="pre">-Ymacro-expand:none</span></code> string has
been added to your compiler settings:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/compiler-after.png"><img alt="img3" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/compiler-after.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>Note that if you decide to <em>revert</em> that change and come back to
a 2.11 configuration, the IDE will look closely at your project&#8217;s
compiler settings as compared to workspace-wide settings. If just
removing scala-version-related makes your project configuration
equivalent to workspace settings, it will automatically revert the
project-specific toggle. your project will again be ruled by
current workspace-wide settings.</p>
<p>Also, note this setting will not affect what your projct is built
with. What your project runs on is, as usual, the compiler it
finds on classpath. But what is actually found on classpath may
vary according to your project&#8217;s specific settings <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id6">[6]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-scala-installation-settings-at-once">
<h3>Multiple Scala Installation Settings at once</h3>
<p>Many of you have multiple projects which version they want to switch
quickly, without having to open project preferences for each project. So,
choosing a Scala Installation is now a multi-select action: just choose
your target projects, right-click, go to the Scala menu, and choose ‘Set
the Scala Installation’, as below.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/new-support/multiselect-action.png"><img alt="img13" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/new-support/multiselect-action.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scala-installation-detection">
<h3>Scala Installation detection</h3>
<p>The IDE will try to understand what version of Scala your project
is designed to work with. It does this by looking at your
<em>resolved</em> classpath. A resolved classpath means &#8220;expanded until
it explicitly contains just paths to existing files&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id7">[7]</a>.
Files in that classpath will possibly contain a scala-library
jar, in which we know where to look for a version, or other,
external jar files which filename might hint at a Scala version.</p>
<p>If we detect a 2.10 scala library, you&#8217;ll see the following
error marker appear in the problems view:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/error-marker.png"><img alt="img4" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/error-marker.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>If you try to quick-fix this error (by pressing Ctrl+1 or right-clicking and selecting Quickfix), you’ll see the following dialog:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/quickfix.png"><img alt="img5" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/quickfix.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>Opening Project Properties here (by clicking <em>Finish</em>) is equivalent to
doing it through menus, you can then toggle project-specific compiler
settings if necessary, and set the correct compiler flags.</p>
<p>A similar dialog will pop up if you have external 2.10 libraries
show up in your classpath.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a project that was created in Eclipse, or if
you are working on a project which Eclipse configuration has
been generated in the past with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse">sbteclipse</a>, you may notice that
those dialogs do not appear. This is because your project is
using a Classpath Container.</p>
<p>Basically, classpath containers are an indirection in your
classpath that is elaborated by the platform Eclipse using
settings. They&#8217;re the technical notion behind the Eclipse feature
named <a class="reference external" href="http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic%3D%252Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%252Freference%252Fpreferences%252Fjava%252Fbuildpath%252Fref-preferences-user-libraries.htm">user libraries.</a></p>
<p>Your project&#8217;s physical representation contains a string (a classpath
container <em>path</em>) in its classpath, that Eclipse resolves depending on its
own settings and context <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id8">[8]</a>. This has been the way Scala projects in the
IDE have been dealt with so far: your projects contained that indirection
as a pointer to a Scala compiler. That pointer was resolved to whichever
version of Scala the current Scala Plugin had been bundled with, so that
as you updated your ScalaIDE plugin over time, your projects were always
built with the latest version of the scala compiler embedded with the IDE.</p>
<p>As of now you have access to the content of the Scala Classpath
Containers. First of all, choosing a project-specific scala
installation in compiler settings, as discussed above, also sets
the classpath container. You can witness that by expanding your
project in the Package Explorer. Here&#8217;s how it look for our test
project, set to use the latest 2.10 Scala above:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/package-explorer.png"><img alt="img6" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/package-explorer.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice this is not the generic 2.11 container you would
get with a fresh new (and therefore 2.11) project. You can also
see that in the <em>Java Build Path</em> preference page in the project
settings:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/properties-build-path.png"><img alt="img7" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/properties-build-path.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>You can also edit this classpath container, by right-clicking in
the <em>Package Explorer</em> view, or by clicking <em>Edit</em> on the <em>Java
Build Path</em> Preference page.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/edit-container.png"><img alt="img8" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/edit-container.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>Choosing a particular installation here will have the same
effect as choosing a particular Scala Installation in the
project&#8217;s compiler settings, as outlined above. In fact, if you
reopen your project&#8217;s settings after applying that classpath
container change, you&#8217;ll notice that the settings for your
installation and use of project-specific settings have changed
appropriately.</p>
<p>Note that if you decide to write a plugin, or do something that
depends on the scala compiler as opposed to just the scala
library, you may want to add another specific container to your
classpath: the Scala compiler. This is possible thanks to the
(usual) <em>Add Library</em> menu of the <em>Java Build Path</em> page. Here,
the Scala Compiler choice will take you to a window very similar
to the above.</p>
<p>Beware this choice will also have an impact on your choice of
Scala installation and associated compiler settings. In fact, to
make sure that the compiler and library container settings would
not get out of sync, we had to make sure that classpath container
edition should not fire if you have both Scala-library and
Scala-compiler on classpath. The best way to proceed is
from a project&#8217;s choice of Scala Installation, which cascades to
classpath containers — and a link will guide you there if you
try to modify such a classpath container directly anyway <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id9">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>This will let you have a project which classpath is managed the
way your choice of Scala Installation is : a fixed set of jars if
this is what you choose, or the latest flavor of your favorite
compiler (whether 2.10 or 2.11), in case you select a dynamic
installation.</p>
<p>But so far, we have only seen how to manage the pre-installed,
embedded versions of the scala library and compiler. How about
dealing with custom, personal installations of Scala that you
may want to use in conjunction with your project&nbsp;?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="byos-bring-your-own-scala">
<h3>BYOS (Bring Your Own Scala)</h3>
<p>If you want to use a custom version of Scala with your project,
there has always been the option of having a manually-managed
classpath. You can either use the <em>Add External Jars</em> function
for the <em>Java Build Path</em> preference page to set up your
scala-compiler and/or scala-library (etc) jars, or you could use
sbteclipse with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EclipseKeys.withBundledScalaContainers:=false</span></code>
option, which copies exactly the settings resolved by sbt.</p>
<p>But using this is tedious, and it&#8217;s per-project. Or perhaps your project
does not have an sbt build. How about setting a custom, workspace-wide
installation that your projects can then reuse ?</p>
<p>This is what you can do from the Scala Installations preference
page. You will find it in the preference dialog for the
workspace.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/scala-installations.png"><img alt="img9" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/scala-installations.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>Notice how there is no notion of dynamic or fixed represented here: those
notions are relevant for a choice of Scala Installation when you configure
a project (dictating how that choice will be realized accross
upgrades). Those are just the installations that are available to your IDE
at the moment.</p>
<p>There you can add and remove an installation according to your
needs. So far, the dialog prompts you for a directory, which
should contain all your jar files, at the root of the
directory. Those should comprise at least of the scala-compiler
and scala-library jar. If there are source jars in that
directory, the IDE will also try to incorporate them in the
installation. It will also try to find extra dependencies
such as scala-reflect.</p>
<p>It will try to do a best effort to understand the version of
your installation given what we know of how such jars are
produced by the compiler build <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id20" id="id10">[10]</a>, and try to check those
jars&#8217; versions are consistent with each other.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now try to add an installation from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.sbt/boot</span></code>
directory, a place where sbt stores the scala jars it requires to
boot.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/sbt-installation.png"><img alt="img10" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/sbt-installation.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>A dialog then comes up asking for a name: this name gives you
the option of labeling a custom installation with a tag that is
easier to find in all the dialogs above, or even to have several
names for a given choice of jars.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/naming-installation.png"><img alt="img11" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/naming-installation.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>You can now see your installation listed in all relevant dialogs
mentioned above, and you can select it in Compiler Settings.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/custom-installation-visible.png"><img alt="img12" src="http://scala-ide.org/resources/images/xsource-screenshots/installations/custom-installation-visible.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a></p>
<p>Note that any scala installation created in that custom manner
is necessarily fixed: dynamic installations vary following
upgrades of the Scala IDE packaged compilers, and we would not
know what to upgrade such a directory-based scala installation
to.</p>
<p>You may also find it constraining to have your scala
installation set as a bunch of jars at the root of a
directory. But it should be possible to convert any setup of a
scala installation to a suitable directory by using symbolic links.</p>
<p>Besides, we firmly intend to implement more ways of defining a
custom scala installation for use in your IDE. If you have a
preferred way (explicitly choosing every jar ? looking at your
maven/ivy cache ?), please <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/scala-ide-dev">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, note that so far, we only support Scala Versions
posterior to 2.10.0. Indeed, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Xsource</span></code> flag only knows so
far how to run both in 2.11 (normal) and 2.10 (compatibility)
modes. But it no longer knows about old typing ways of the past.</p>

<p>Scala IDE uses AOP to tweak the Eclipse JDT, so JDT weaving has to be enable. Otherwise, Scala files would be managed as Java files.</p>
<p>It is set in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">JDT</span> <span class="pre">Weaving</span></code> section of Scala Setup Diagnostics dialog <a class="footnote-reference" href="#diagnostics" id="id21">[12]</a>. <em>JDT Weaving</em> should be checked (and disabled, to prevent accidental changes).

<h3>Optional Preferences</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Heap Status</strong></p>
<p>When the memory usage nears the limit, the Garbage Collector activity increases (when the compiler runs, ...) and system slows down. It is good to keep a eye on the heap status. It is possible by enabling <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Show</span> <span class="pre">heap</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">General</span></code> section <a class="footnote-reference" href="#preferences" id="id22">[11]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Limit Simultaneously Open Editors</strong></p>
<p>Having too many editors open can claim a lot of memory. Unless you are an exceptional multi-tasker or you use a task-focused interface such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Mylyn</a>, you may want to limit the number of simultaneously opened editors in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">General</span></code> section <a class="footnote-reference" href="#preferences" id="id23">[11]</a>..</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/limit-editors.png"><img alt="../../_images/limit-editors2.png" src="../../_images/limit-editors2.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Deactivate Automatic Java Content Assist</strong></p>
<p>Since Scala-IDE is built over JDT, the Java Content Assist is enabled by default for Scala files, even though it is not relevant for Scala language files development. You can safely deactivate it if most of your edition is done in Scala files.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Garbage Collection activity and swap can be really bad for performance. It can trigger Eclipse freezes and cuase a general system slow down.</p>
<p>Monitoring what is happening is the best option to keep a healthy system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to monitor CPU and swap, use your native system monitor (some of the other system monitors are big resource users themselves).</li>
<li>to monitor Garbage Collector activity, use <em>visualvm</em> on the eclipse instance. It is a profiling tool provided with jdk 1.6.x. It is possible also to get a feel of the memory usage with the heap status bar <a class="reference internal" href="#optional-preferences">Optional Preferences</a> in Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending of the problem, the memory allocated to the JVM can be increased, or some of the other application closed (like the web browser, or some flash application, ...).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="memory-consumption-new">
<h3>Memory consumption <span class="raw-html"><span class="label info">new</span></span></h3>
<p>The Scala IDE for Eclipse uses the Scala Presentation Compiler which provides semantic features such as live error markers, inferred type hovers etc.</p>
<p>Each project has its own presentation compiler instance working in a separate thread. It is created after importing or opening a previously closed project, as well as when you open .scala file or type something and a presentation compiler didn&#8217;t exist at a given moment.</p>
<p>In the case of complex projects with many dependencies, each presentation compiler can consume a lot of memory. Therefore, there&#8217;s a special mechanism which can close presentation compilers automatically. It can do that when a given project still exists in a workspace, but when the user hasn&#8217;t edited its code for a long time and there are no opened Scala Editors for the files managed by given presentation compilers.</p>
<p>You can specify a length of inactivity in seconds, after which the presentation compiler can be closed. Note that the presentation compiler will have to be recreated, when you will open the first file for a project. This can cause a small delay but in most of cases it shouldn&#8217;t be significant - up to several seconds in the case of big projects. After that there are no other noticeable effects.</p>
