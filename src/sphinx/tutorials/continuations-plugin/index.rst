Enabling Scala continuations plugin in the Scala IDE
====================================================

Prerequisites
.............

*   `Eclipse`_ 3.6 (Helios) with a `Scala IDE 2.0`_ installed, or
    `Eclipse`_ 3.7 (Indigo) with a `Scala IDE Helium nightly`_ installed.

    Check the :doc:`getting started </current-user-doc/gettingstarted/index>` page for instructions on how to install Scala IDE.

*   A basic knowledge of the Eclipse user interface is required.

*   No knowledge of the Scala language is required (in this guide).

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial you will learn how to enable continuations in the Scala IDE. Scala provides
support for `continuation-passing style`_ through a compiler plugin, which is shipped together with
the main Scala distribution.

Enabling continuations in Scala 2.9 is really simple, you only need to pass
``-P:continuations:enable`` to the Scala compiler, and the continuations plugin will be loaded and
used to compile your sources.

Note that in Scala 2.10 (trunk) the continuations plugin is enabled by default. Meaning that
no configuration is needed to use continuations in the Scala IDE with Scala 2.10!

In this tutorial we will learn how to enable the continuations plugin with the Scala IDE for Scala 2.9.

Enabling continuations plugin
-----------------------------

Assume you have a source file requiring the continuations plugin to be enabled. Chances are that in
the Problems view you will get an error message such as: *this code must be compiled with the Scala
continuations plugin enabled*.

Let's fix this!
Right click on your project folder and select Properties.

.. image:: images/2-project-properties.png

  :target: ../../_images/2-project-properties.png

Then, under Scala Compiler, click on **Use Project Settings**.

.. image:: images/3-use-project-settings.png
  :alt: Use project settings
  :width: 100%
  :target: ../../_images/3-use-project-settings.png

Now, write **continuations:enable** in the ``P`` field.

.. image:: images/4-enable-continuations-plugin.png
  :alt: Enable the continuations plugin
  :width: 100%
  :target: ../../_images/4-enable-continuations-plugin.png

`Apply` then `Ok` to close the properties window. The errors should go away (if that is not the
case, rebuild your sources).

.. image:: images/5-no-errors.png
  :alt: No more errors in the project
  :width: 100%
  :target: ../../_images/5-no-errors.png

That's it! You have successfully enabled continuations in your project.

Known Problems
--------------

Unfortunately, we found out that plugin settings in the Scala IDE 2.0.0 are not always correctly
handled. The good news is that the issue has been fixed, and the patch is already available in both
the `Scala IDE 2.0.x` nightly and the `Scala IDE Helium` nightly.

If you are using the Scala IDE 2.0.0 and the above step-by-step description does not work in your
case, we suggest you to do the following:

1. Pass to ``-Xplugin`` the path to the ``continuations.jar``.

	* **Important:** Make sure that the path contains **no whitespaces**.

2. Pass ``continuations:enable`` to the ``P`` compiler setting.

But the best suggestion we have is to use the `Scala IDE 2.0.x nightly`_, if you can do so.
