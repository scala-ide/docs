2.0.0-beta10 (released: 2011-09-13)
......................................

* new SBT-based builder with inter-project dependencies. The default builder remains 'refined', but you can enable the SBT builder in Eclipse -> Preferences -> Scala  -> Compiler -> Build manager.
* better integration of mixed Scala/Java project (no more spurious errors when Java classes call Scala classes that contain annotations).
* new field in Compiler preferences for additional command line parameters, cleanup of compiler options.
* new "Show Inferred Semicolons" feature: :doc:`2.0.x/features/typingviewing`.
* syntax colouring for new REPL view.
* stop inappropriate Java save actions firing on Scala source. `#1534`_
* corrected cursor's positioning after asking completion.
* better navigation and occurrences highlighting when clicking on ``import`` clauses.
* Error Log is not in the default Scala perspective anymore.
* fixed Toggle Comment action which was incorrectly commenting an additional line. `#1000462`_

.. _#1000462: https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000462

2.0.0-beta09 (released: 2011-07-21)
......................................

* better breakpoint support (fixes errors when setting breakpoints in traits coming from external libraries).
* better completions (works in many more situations, such as partially typed method names).
* better diagnostics ('no completions at all syndrome') and re-setting the Java completions flag.
* better integration with Eclipse. When clicking a Scala classfile on a stack trace report, the Scala file editor will be correctly opened and functionalities such as navigation and setting breakpoint just work.
* moved Scala completions to its own category (instead of Java Proposals). This eliminates a source of incompatibilities with the Mylyn plugin. Now you can enable/disable Scala completions from Preferences, Java/Editor/ContentAssist/Advanced Scala Completions and Scala Completions (Java sources).
* added package object wizard.

2.0.0-beta08 (released: 2011-07-12)
......................................

* fixed large memory leak in mark occurrences.
* new Run Selection REPL: edit window for commands (with history). Try it by pressing Ctrl-Shift-X inside a Scala editor to run the selected expression (or the current line). :doc:`Read more <2.0.x/features/scalainterpreter>`.
* JUnit runner finds tests in Scala files reliably (even when files are not open).
* Fixed errors shown in Java sources coming from the Scala compiler.
* Fixed crash in Java completion for Scala classes in the default (empty) package.

2.0.0-beta6
...............

* Improved stability (correct use of 'ask' calls)
* Removed dummy features used for upgrading from the old 2.7 IDE.
* Better description of the JDT weaving feature when installing it.
* Downgraded the JDT weaving plugin to the latest released version. We were using the development repository, and that caused conflicts on installation, when the user had AspectJ (or was using STS) installed -- requiring the user to unselect the JDT weaving plugin from our update site. Now the versions are the same, and no conflict is reported.
* Organize Imports improvements: various configuration options and support for adding missing imports.
* Eclipse 3.7.0 (Indigo) compatibility
* New REPL view: Launch by selecting text and pressing Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on the Mac).
    * A different key combination can be set by going to General -> Keys, and redefining the key binding for "Send Selection to REPL."
    * The interpreter can be stopped and restarted, with optional replay.
    * NOTE: the colon commands (e.g. ":implicits") that work in the terminal REPL do not yet work in this REPL view, but this will be fixed for the next beta.

2.0.0-beta2
..............

* Fixes various crashes in the structure builder, leading to un-editable files in Eclipse.
* Correctly saves preferences for the diagnostics window.
* Correctly show bean getters/setters in mixed Java/Scala projects.
* Performance improvements in structured selection.
* New formatter preference window, with preview.
* Format selection only.
* Better memory usage when closing projects.
* Allow compiler plugins in the presentation compiler.
* other bug fixes.
