Structured Selection
====================

Using ``alt+shift+up`` and ``alt+shift+down`` selects larger or smaller portion of the AST. It allows for quick selection of sub-expressions or statements.

.. note::
	Shortcuts are platform-dependent, and can be re-configured in the ``Keys`` preference page. The actions are named **Select Enclosing Element** and **Restore Last Selection**.

This feature will also benefit from hover typing, just as when
you place the cursor on a specific element.
