Implicit Hyperlinking
=====================

.. note::

	`Implicit Highlighting`__ needs to be enabled.

With *Implicit Hyperlinking* you can hyperlink to an implicit declaration.

Hold down |keystroke-mouse| and hover over a binding. If an implicit conversion 
has been applied to the hovered binding, a contextual menu will open, giving you a chance 
to navigate to either the binding's declaration (a.k.a. 
`definition hyperlinking`__) or to the implicit declaration!

And if you don't like to touch your mouse too much, just hit |keystroke-keyboard| and 
immediately navigate to the implicit declaration.
