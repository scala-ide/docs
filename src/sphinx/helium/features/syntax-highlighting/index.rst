Syntax Highlighting
===================

Syntax highlighting is one of the most important features of an editor wherefore Scala IDE provides this feature in a way that it can highlight the complete grammar of Scala.

Overview
--------

As one can see in the following preview, syntax highlighting works not only for Scala code, but also for Scaladoc and for string interpolation:

In the following picture there are all literals shown that are available in Scala. Note that escape sequences are shown in string and char literals as well as Unicode and octal sequences.

Configuration
-------------

There are several options available how syntax highlighting can be configured. Beside the possibility to set fore- and background color it is possible to paint the text in bold and italic or to underline it.

Summary
-------

Even though syntax highlighting is indispensable for code readability it is nothing compared to a full-fledged `semantic highlighting`_, which Scala IDE of course doesn't lack either.
