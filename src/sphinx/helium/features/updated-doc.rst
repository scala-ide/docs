Mark Occurrences
----------------

As in the Java tooling, Mark Occurrences highlights within a file where a type, variable or method is referenced.

This feature is disabled by default, as it can have an impact on the editor performance, but it is really useful when exploring code. 

It can be enabled in the ``Scala -> Editor`` preference page, or using the button in the main toolbar.
