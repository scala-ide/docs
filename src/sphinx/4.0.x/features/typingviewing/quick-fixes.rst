Create Method and Class
-----------------------

For the following code snippet there exists a quick fix for the method call of ``g``:

.. image:: images/create-method.png

The result of applying this quick fix is the following::

  object Test extends App {
  
    def f() {
      val value = g("a string")
    }
  
    def g(arg: String) = {
      ???
    }
  }

As one can see in the screenshot above it is also possible to create classes, not only methods.

Change Capitalization
---------------------

If one did a type error in the name of a method, it is possible to correct this as long as the only type error is due to wrong capitalization:
