Suggested Shortcuts
===================

Here you can find a collection of shortcuts you will find useful for Scala development. Replace ``Ctrl`` by ``CMD`` if you are using a Mac.


* ``Alt+Shift+X S`` : Run As Scala Application. It is quicker than the popup menu because it does not need to scan every Launcher to see what type of Launches can be acted upon.
* ``Alt+Shift+X T`` : Run As JUnit. Also quicker than a popup menu for the same reasons.
* ``Ctrl+Space``    : completion (using code, templates,...)
* ``Alt + /``       : complete word (unless you have chosen to integrate word completion in completion proposals above)
* ``Ctrl + /``        : toggle comment of a block (the selected line(s) or current line)
*  ``Ctrl-3`` Quick Access -- a huge time saver. Opens up a dialog with incremental search on all commands available on the platform
*  ``Ctrl-Shift-R`` Open Resource -- opens up a dialog with incremental search on all files in the workspace
* ``Ctrl-.`` Go to the next error in the current editor
* ``F2`` Show the error for the position under the cursor
* ``F3`` Navigate to definition (same as ``Ctrl-click`` on an identifier)
* ``Ctrl-O`` Quick Outline -- opens up a dialog with incremental search on all definitions in the current editor
* ``Ctrl-J`` Incremental search
* ``Ctrl-F11`` Launch the debugger. By default it tries to launch the current file. I configure Eclipse to always launch the last application.
* ``Ctrl-Shift-F11`` Launch the application (with no debugger attached)
