Expression evaluator |new|
==========================

Scala debugger uses new expression evaluator, which translates user code into invocations of ``JDI`` remote calls. This allows evaluation of expression in context of some breakpoint, with access to local variables and methods.

.. _expression-evaluator:

Expression evaluation
---------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Main entry point into expression evaluation in Scala IDE debugger is ``ExpressionManager`` object, which is initialized from ``ScalaDebugger`` during debug and takes care of holding debug session state, and evaluating expressions in GUI friendly way.

Expression evaluation is done in ``ExpressionEvaluator`` which parses the code using ``ToolBox``, applies several transformations to it and then compiles the result with ``ToolBox``.

Transformation phases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before evaluation multiple AST transformations (called ``phases``) are performed.

First few of them are necessary to make user-defined code type-check:

* code is packed into function from :ref:`expression-evaluator_jdi-context` to :ref:`expression-evaluator_jdi-proxy`,
* unbound variables are mocked,
* usages of ``this`` are mocked,
* and lamba bodies are replaced with stubs of correct types.

Next comes type-check (from ``ToolBox``), which expands implicits, assign types and make some other Scala magic.

After type-check code is transformed further to allow remote execution:

* all used variables and objects are implemented using :ref:`expression-evaluator_jdi-proxy`,
* constructor calls are proxied to create new instances on debugged jvm,
* bodies of lambdas are compiled and bytecode is loaded on debugged jvn,
* conditional expressions are changed to work with proxies,
* same with toString invocations,
* literals and constants are proxied,
* and all mocks from earlier stages are replaced with concrete implementation.

After that code is compiled and result is a function ``JdiContext => JdiProxy``.

Each phase have access to ``TypesContext``, which is mutable, append-only structure which stores information about types encountered during transformation for further processing.

.. _expression-evaluator_jdi-proxy:

JdiProxy
~~~~~~~~

Every unbound variable used in evaluated expression is replaced with instance of ``JdiProxy``. Those proxies uses ``scala.Dynamic`` trait to intercept all method calls and proxy them to debugged jvm.

Because of synthetic methods on primitive types, boxed types and ``java.lang.String`` we had to create a separate proxy flavors for each of them.

* Numeric addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo are aggregated under ``NumericOperations``.
* Bitwise OR, AND and XOR are aggregated under ``BitwiseOperations``.
* Comparison (<, >, <= and >=) is implemented in ``BooleanComparison`` and ``NumericComparison``.
* Logical operations (for Boolean proxies) are implemented in ``LogicalOperations``.

All above sits in package ``org.scalaide.debug.internal.expression.proxies.primitives``.

.. _expression-evaluator_jdi-context:

JdiContext
~~~~~~~~~~

All methods related to debugged jvm are encapsulated within a ``JdiContext`` instance. It provides abilities to:

* run methods on debugged jvm,
* access types and values in context of debugged jvm,
* load new classes on debugged jvm,
* create proxies for values and object by name,
* and create String representations of proxies.

Conditional breakpoints
-----------------------

Support for conditional breakpoint is placed in ``ConditionManager`` and relies on ``ExpressionManager`` to do all heavy lifting.
