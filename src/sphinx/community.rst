Reporting Problems
------------------

We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports. There are a few pieces of information that are helpful to have when you report a bug:

* The version of Eclipse Scala IDE is running on. It is available under ``Help → About`` (``Eclipse → About`` on Mac osX). It appears as 'version number' and a 'build id'.

* The version of Scala IDE used. There are 2 ways to obtain it:

  * Using ``Scala → Report a Bug...``. The window opened contains the plug-in version, and a link to the tickets page.

  * In the ``About`` page, using ``Installation Details``. It is the version of 'Scala IDE for Eclipse'.

Please, first explore the `existing tickets`_. If you cannot add your contribution to any of them, use the ``New Ticket`` button on the `support page`_.

If you're unsure if you have found an issue or not, please don't hesitate to ask on the `scala-ide-user`_ mailing list.
