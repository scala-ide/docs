   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Scala IDE's documentation!
=====================================

`Scala IDE`_ provides support for development of Scala applications in the Eclipse platform. Its main target is the support for the `Scala`_ language and the integration with the Eclipse Java tools. It provides many of the features Eclipse users have come to expect including:

* Support for mixed Scala/Java projects and any combination of Scala/Java project dependencies. Type driven operations are transparent across Scala and Java files and projects, allowing straightforward references from Scala to Java and vice versa.

* A Scala editor with syntax highlighting, inferred type,  hyperlinking to definitions, code completion, error and warning markers, indentation, brace matching.

* Project and source navigation including Scala support in the Package explorer view with embedded outline, outline view, quick outline, open type, open type hierarchy.

* Incremental compilation, application launching with integrated debugger, hyperlinking from stack traces to Scala source, interactive console.

* Support for Eclipse plug-in and OSGi development including hyperlinking to Scala source from plugin.xml and manifest files.

The Scala IDE is released under a :doc:`BSD-like license <license>` and community involvement in its development is strongly encouraged. See the :doc:`Developer Documentation <dev/index>` on how to take part.

This documentation is the starting point for the installation guide and other information regarding the use of the Scala IDE for Eclipse.
