Scala Interpreter
=================

Scala IDE integrate the Scala REPL. It is set in a view called ``Scala Interpreter``.

Each view instance is associated to a project, and all artifacts defined or referenced in the project are available to the interpreter.

Starting the interpreter
------------------------

There are multiple ways to start it:

* Opening the view. The view can be opened with ``Window → Show View → Scala Interpreter`` from the Scala perspective, or ``Window → Show View → Other... → Scala → Scala Interpreter`` from anywhere. This will display the list of available projects. The interpreter is initialized and configured to use the selected one.

* Executing some code. The |runSelection| ``Run Selection in Scala Interpreter`` command triggers the creation of a view for the current project if needed. The code currently selected in the editor is then run in the interpreter.

Using the interpreter
---------------------

1. Scala code can be entered directly in the interpreter view, in the ``Evaluate`` field.

   The previously entered commands are kept in a history. They can be browsed using the ``Up`` and ``Down`` arrow keys.

#. Existing code can be selected in the Scala Editor, and run in the interpreter using the |runSelection| ``Run Selection in Scala Interpreter`` command.

   The command can also be invoked using the ``Ctrl+Shift+x`` or ``Cmd+Shift+x`` key shortcut.

#. An other way is to use the interpreter is combination with an editor to test new code.

   With a little bit of wrapping code, it is possible to create a setup where any code can be entered, and type checked. Then the code can be run in the interpreter to see its result.

Toolbar
-------

The toolbar contains the following five buttons:

================= ================================= ================================================================================================
|replayAll|       Replay All Commands                Execute again all commands from the current session.
|terminate|       Terminate                         Stop the interpreter.
|terminateReplay| Terminate and Replay              Reset the interpreter, and execute again all commands from the current session.
|clear|           Clear Output                      Clear the view, but keeps the current session state.
|autoreplay|      Replay History on Project Rebuild If enable, the commands from the current session are executed every time the project is rebuilt.
