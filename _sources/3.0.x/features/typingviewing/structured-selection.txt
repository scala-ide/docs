Structured Selection
====================

Using ``alt+shift+up`` and ``alt+shift+down`` selects larger or smaller portion of the AST. It allows for quick selection of sub-expressions or statements.

.. note::
	Shortcuts are platform-dependent, and can be re-configured in the ``Keys`` preference page. The actions are named **Select Enclosing Element** and **Restore Last Selection**.

Hovering over the selection will also bring up a dialog dispaying
the inferred type of the selected expression, just as it would if
you put the cursor on a :doc:`specific element <inferred-hover>`.
