Architecture
============

In this page you will learn about the Scala IDE's architecture. First, an overview of the 
different existing modules is provided. Then, a few specific aspects of the Scala IDE's architecture 
and its components are discussed.


Overview
--------

The Scala IDE project is composed of several modules. Here is a generic description of what each module contains:

* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core``: Contains the Scala IDE plug-in's source code.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core.tests``: Contains the functional tests used to exercise the Scala IDE in headless mode (with no User Interface).
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug``: Contains the Scala IDE debugger plug-in's source code.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug.tests``: Contains the functional tests used to exercise the Scala IDE debugger in headless mode (with no User Interface).
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug.expression``: Contains Scala IDE expression evaluator plug-in's source code.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug.expression.tests``: Contains the functional tests used to exercise the Scala IDE expression evaluator in headless mode (with no User Interface).
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.spy``: A Scala Spy view, used to display position, tree and type information under the cursor.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.aspects``: Contains the AspectJ classes used to weave into Eclipse and hook in JDT internals.
* ``org.scala-ide.build``: Contains the scripts for building the Scala IDE from the command line.
* ``org.scala-ide.build-toolchain``: Contains the script for retrieving and repackaging dependencies that are needed by the Scala IDE.
* ``org.scala-ide.sbt.*``: Contain scripts for repackaging the Sbt incremental compiler as a Maven dependency.
* ``org.scala-ide.scala*``: Contain scripts for packaging Scala (2.10, 2.11) as features that can be installed in Eclipse
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.feature``: Packages the ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core`` and ``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug`` project binaries into the "Scala IDE for Eclipse" component, which is then made available through the Scala IDE update site.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.source.feature``: Packages both the ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core`` and ``org.scala-ide.sdt.aspects`` project sources into the "Scala IDE for Eclipse Source Feature" component, which is then made available through the Scala IDE update site.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.weaving.feature``: Packages the ``org.scala-ide.sdt.aspects`` project binaries into the "JDT Weaving for Scala" component, which is included within the "Scala IDE for Eclipse" component.
* ``org.scala-ide.sdt.update-site``: Contains the result of a successful compilation of the Scala IDE project, packaged in the form expected by the Eclipse Update Manager.

The Build system
----------------

The Scala IDE build system is based on Maven and Tycho, but it has a few particularities. In most cases running the ``build-all.sh`` script should be sufficient, but in case you need to make changes or debug a failed nightly, the following information may prove useful.

Tycho
~~~~~

Tycho brings Eclipse specific dependency management to Maven, essentially resolving *Require-Bundle* or *Import-Package* entries in ``MANIFEST.MF`` files. To this end it scans manifests early on in the build cycle and uses P2 repositories to locate the best match for each dependency. In other words, it builds a so-called *target-platform*, containing all the required bundles (jar files).

POM-first
~~~~~~~~~

In the real world not all dependencies will be available in P2 repositories. Tycho considers plain Maven (pom) dependencies as well, as long as the jar files have a ``MANIFEST.MF`` file. This is the case for Scala: the standard library, compiler and Scala modules (from 2.11 onwards) have correct ``MANIFEST.MF`` files, and the Scala IDE build is using them directly in its build.

Repackaging
~~~~~~~~~~~

In the worst case, the required dependency is only available as a plain jar, but no ``MANIFEST`` file is provided. The solution is to re-package them using the maven bundle plugin who generates a manifest. This is what the ``org.scala-ide.sbt.full.library`` and ``org.scala-ide.sbt.compiler.interface`` projects are doing for the Sbt incremental compiler.

.. note::
	Tycho requires pom-first dependencies to be available in a maven repository during the *initialize* maven lifecycle. This means that repackaged dependencies have to be built and published in a separate maven run. Listing them in the same parent pom as separate modules won't cut it. This is the reason why we need the toolchain build.

The set-featues step
--------------------

Currently we cross-build against Scala 2.10 and 2.11. Due to modularization, the Scala bundles we have to ship differ between the two versions, leading to different ``features.xml`` files in the two cases. Unfortunately, due to Tycho building the target platform so early in the build lifecycle, we cannot produce these files in the same maven run, or even the same build. This is handled by using the ``set-features`` profile in the root ``pom.xml``, and called by ``build.sh`` before handing it over to the "main" build.


Scala IDE & Eclipse JDT
-----------------------

The Scala IDE uses the `Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT) <http://eclipse.org/jdt/>`_ weaving 
in order to inherit as much as possible of the existing Eclipse Java functionality. AspectJ 
and the weaving service of Eclipse (in fact, its OSGi container, called Equinox) allow us to 
intercept method calls in the JDT, and provide Scala-specific implementations for things like the 
`source file editor 
<https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/scala/tools/eclipse/ScalaSourceFileEditor.scala>`_ 
or the `indexer 
<https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/scala/tools/eclipse/javaelements/ScalaIndexBuilder.scala>`_.

By hooking into the JDT, and providing specific implementations of JDT interfaces, Scala entities
(classes, types, methods, etc) are seen by the JDT as Java elements, meaning:

* Java code completion “sees” Scala classes.
* The Java presentation compiler “sees” errors when using Scala classes.
* JDT tools, such as the JUnit runner, just ‘work’.
* Lots of UI elements can be reused (the Outline View, Package Explorer, etc).

Of course, Scala entities can not be faithfully represented in Java terms. Some Scala features will 
be therefore only partially supported when working in mixed Java-Scala projects (for instance, 
type members are represented as normal, value fields). 

.. note:: 

	This will hopefully change in the near future, as we plan to create our own models for 
	representing Scala entities and hook that into JDT (rather than the current solution, where we 
	are using Java models to expose Scala entities).
	
Although not intended to be extended with other languages, the JDT offers extension points for some 
functionality. Whenever possible, we prefer to use the regular, supported mechanism for extension, 
instead of weaving. This is the case for both code completion and hyperlinking.

JDT Weaving and Java integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Scala aspect code is found in ``org.scala-ide.sdt.aspects`` project. This module defines:

* pointcuts and aspects to intercept JDT method calls,
* Java interfaces and classes that are used by these aspects. The main IDE module, ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core`` implements or inherits these classes. This way, there is a clean separation between the hooks, and the actual implementations.

The other side of this coin is the actual Scala-specific implementation in 
``org.scala-ide.sdt.core``. The package ``org.scalaide.core.internal.jdt.model`` contains Scala 
subclasses of Java element classes, such as ``ScalaClassElement`` or ``ScalaDefElement``.

Although the JDT defines interfaces for these elements, we inherit from their internal 
implementations. This makes our code prone to breakage in newer releases of the JDT, but gives us 
much more functionality. In some cases it is even impossible to do otherwise, as the JDT code itself 
casts such interfaces to their concrete, internal, implementations. 

.. note:: 

	As mentioned in the previous section, we plan to create our own models for representing Scala 
	entities. That will help us better representing Scala entities in the editor and it will 
	mitigate incompatibilities with newer version of the JDT.

Scala IDE debugger
------------------

The Scala IDE debugger is using the standard Java debugging chain (JVMDI, JDWP and JDI) to provide a Scala specific debugger. The elements are displayed the Scala way, the names are decoded, and the actions are behaving the way a Scala developer would expect.

See also :ref:`expression-evaluator`.

The Scala Structure Builder
---------------------------

The workhorse of Java-Scala integration is the `ScalaStructureBuilder 
<http://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/org/scalaide/core/internal/jdt/model/ScalaStructureBuilder.scala>`_ 
class. This class translates Scala sources (using the Abstract Syntax Trees - AST) to the JDT model elements (using the 
`Scala specific subclasses 
<http://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/org/scalaide/core/internal/jdt/model/ScalaElements.scala>`_, 
of course), and it is fully responsible for the way the Eclipse Java compiler (and related JDT tools 
or UI elements) sees Scala code.

.. note:: 
	This approach has some important limitation with respect to correct interoperation of mixed 
	Scala/Java code, and it is the source of several issues in the Scala IDE. One major point of 
	pain is that the Scala Structure Builder needs to faithfully emulate the Scala compiler to 
	provide correct interoperation between Scala and Java code. Doing this in general is: 
	
	* difficult, as we are somewhat trying to re-engineer what the compiler already does when it produces bytecode, and 
	* fragile, as the produced bytecode may vary from one Scala version to another. 
	
	In the future we would like to explore other roads. For instance, we have been thinking about 
	using the binaries (instead of the sources), so that we would not need to duplicate the Scala 
	compiler backend's logic. Though, doing this would force users working on mixed Scala/Java projects 
	to enable continuous build (to make sure that the class binaries are actually produced), which 
	may not be acceptable.
	
The Scala Presentation Compiler
-------------------------------

In order to provide semantic actions, the IDE needs to *understand* the edited Scala code. That 
means parsing and type-checking. :ref:`scalapresentationcompiler` is an asynchronous front-end compiler for Scala, part of the standard Scala compiler.

Code formatting
---------------

Code formatting is delegated to `Scalariform <https://github.com/mdr/scalariform/>`_, a library for 
automated Scala formatting written by Matt Russell. `Structured selection 
<https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/org/scalaide/ui/internal/actions/ScalaStructureSelectEnclosingAction.scala>`_ 
and `tokenising 
<https://github.com/mdr/Scala-IDE/blob/f1a02cd3455aead4582a1652beddcc0b3dbd0f10/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/org/scalaide/core/internal/lexical/ScalaCodeScanner.scala>`_ 
for syntax coloring are also backed by Scalariform.


Refactoring
-----------

Refactoring is delegated to the `scala-refactoring <http://scala-refactoring.org/>`_ library written 
by Mirko Stocker.
