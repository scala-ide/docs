What to work on
===============

You probably already know exactly what you're interested in working on! Whatever you decide to work 
on, please post a message on the `scala-ide-dev <http://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-dev>`_ 
list to see if anyone else is working on anything related and collaborate if possible.

If you are looking around for things to work on, have a look at the `Enhancements 
<https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/milestones/454722-enhancements>`_ milestones. We listed 
a number of well-delimited improvements that are nice-to-have and nobody is currently working on.

See `Open Tickets <http://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets>`_ for further 
inspiration.

Last, our :ref:`testing_regression-test-suite` could be expanded. Creating tests is one of the best 
way to start contributing now and bring immediate value to the project!
