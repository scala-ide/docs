Git

.. epigraph::
	
	Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed 
	and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. Every Git working directory is a 
	full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not 
	dependent on network access or a central server. Git's current software maintenance is overseen 
	by Junio Hamano. Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License 
	version 2.

You can download git `here`__.

The web is full of good tutorials to get started with Git. If you don't know where to start, we suggest 
you to begin by reading the first three chapters of `Git Pro book`__, which introduces all 
concepts needed to get started with git.

Don't get discouraged by git, at the beginning it may be bit painful to get your head around it, 
as its philosophy is a lot different from other tools you may got yourself acquainted with 
(read CVS or SVN). You may feel lost, but don't give up. Your effort will be soon recompensed, 
and once you understand the philosophy and are comfortable with the basic commands, you will likely 
start to appreciate its simplicity (and at that point, you may even discover that you will never 
want to go back to something different ;)).

I also encourage you to learn the command line commands. Knowing the commands will help you 
understand how git works, and will allow you to take full advantage of git. That can really bring 
your productivity to the next level!

Graphical git client exist, and they can be handy for checking the logs and do many other read-only 
operations. Here is a incomplete list of Git client that you may want to check.

* `SourceTree <http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`_: Very nice and it offers quite a few features. 
  Unfortunately, it is available only for Mac OSX.
  
* `GitX <http://gitx.laullon.com/>`_: Another nice and simple git client. Unfortunately, it is 
  available only for Mac OSX.
  
* `GitHub:Mac <http://mac.github.com/>`_: It's the GitHub git client, so it's nicely integrated with 
  GitHub, but you won't be able to use with a git repository that is not hosted on git.

* `SmartGit <http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html>`_: Available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux, 
  it is a good option. Only problem: it's not free :(
  

GitHub

.. epigraph::

	GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git 
	revision control system. GitHub offers both commercial plans and free accounts for open source 
	projects. According to the Git User's Survey in 2009, GitHub is the most popular Git hosting 
	site.

GitHub is really awesome and it's one of the best thing that happened in the Open Source Software 
ecosystem. The social coding experience, the slick UI, the gigantic number of features that any 
project can use for free (code review, issue tracking, forking, ...). If you are not on GitHub, you 
are really missing out on something amazing.

A continuously increasing number of project has moved to GitHub. Both `Scala 
<https://github.com/scala/scala>`_ and the `Scala IDE 
<https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide>`_ projects are on GitHub, and even `Linux has a mirror on 
GitHub <https://github.com/mirrors/linux>`_!
