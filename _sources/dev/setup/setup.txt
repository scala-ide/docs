Setup
=====

In this page you will learn everything you need to know to setup the Scala IDE plug-in project in Eclipse.
You are literally instants away from being all set and ready to start hacking the Scala IDE sources!

Requirements
------------

* `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`_, including JDT (by 2017-04, Eclipse 4.6 Neon should be used). Look for
  **Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers**, which comes with `Eclipse Plug-In Development Environment pre-installed`.
  You can use this Eclipse installation to develop the plug-in, run unit tests, debug changes to the plug-in, etc.

* The `Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) <http://www.eclipse.org/pde/>`_, which ships with the
  Eclipse SDK (**Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers**) but may need to be installed manually.  Choose ``Help > Install New Software...``,
  select the release update site for the given version of Eclipse (ie. for Eclipse 4.6 Neon, choose
  `<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon>`_), then install
  ``General Purpose Tools > Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment``.

* The `Scala IDE plug-in nightly <http://scala-ide.org/download/nightly.html>`_. Make sure you are using the latest nightly.

* `Java 8 is required for Eclipse 4.6 <http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Installation#Install_a_JVM>`_.

* `Maven 3 <http://maven.apache.org/download.html>`_.

* `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ and a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account.

This document uses a script to build the Scala IDE plug-in. If you are on Windows, you could try `Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>`_. Otherwise, the :ref:`building_run-the-build` section of the documentation describes the different steps to execute for a full build.

.. _setup_fork-the-project:

Fork the project
----------------

The first thing you should do is forking the `Scala IDE repository <http://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide>`_,
that will greatly simplify the process of sending us patches (remember to also read about the
:ref:`workflow_page` before creating pull requests).

If you are new to GitHub, `read here to learn how to fork a project
<http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/>`_.

After forking the project, simply open a terminal and clone your own fork to download the project's
sources. The command for cloning the fork should be very close to the following one (mind that
you will have to replace *<username>* with your actual Git username).

.. code-block:: bash

        $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/scala-ide.git

Make sure to `add an Upstream <http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/#Set-Up-Your-Local-Repo>`_ pointing
to the original Scala IDE git remote repository, so that you can keep fetching the latest changes
made in the project, and easily integrate them back in your fork.

Pull the libraries
------------------

The Scala IDE projects uses libraries which are pulled during the build process and copied in the ``target/lib`` folders.
So let's run the build.

From the project root, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./build-all.sh

In case you want to modify the default build you can pass different profiles:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./build-all.sh -P scala-2.11.x -P eclipse-luna clean install

If you want more information concerning the build, check out :ref:`building_run-the-build`.

Import the projects into Eclipse
--------------------------------

The Scala IDE project already contains the metadata files needed by Eclipse to setup the project.
To import the Scala IDE in your workspace simply click on ``File > Import``. The Eclipse Import dialog
will open. There, select ``General > Existing Projects into Workspace`` and click Next. A new dialog
will open. Browse to the folder that points to your cloned Scala IDE project's and select it.

A list of projects should then be loaded in the below white area. The only projects that you absolutely
need to import in Eclipse are ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core`` and ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core.tests``. If you want
to work on Debugger select also ``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug(.tests)`` and for expression evaluator add
``org.scala-ide.sdt.debug.expression(.tests)``. Select projects you want to work on and click Finish.

.. note:: If you want to hack on the Debugger it may be necessary for Linux systems to add the ``tools.jar`` to the classpath. This can be achieved by navigating to ``Preferences → Java → Installed JREs`` and adding the JAR to the JRE that builds your sources. The JAR itself can be found at ``<path-to-JRE/lib/tools.jar>``.

If after rebuilding you see any errors, drop us a note in the `Scala IDE Developer
Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-dev?pli=1>`_.

Install the Scalastyle plugin
-----------------------------

The Scala IDE uses `Scalastyle <http://www.scalastyle.org/>`_ to ensure a clean code base. Thus, while it is not
absolutely necessary, we recommend to install the Scalastyle plugin that will show errors whenever the style rules
are violated. The update site for the plugin can be found on the homepage of Scalastyle.

After installing the plugin one needs to add the Scalastyle configuration of the Scala IDE. This can easily be done
in ``Window → Preferences → Scalastyle → Browse/Add``, where the configuration can be found at ``<path-to-scala-ide>/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/scala-ide-style-config.xml``.
The Scalastyle builder is already added to all projects that should be checked, thus no further configuration is required.

It is also possible to run Scalastyle on the shell. For this type

    mvn scalastyle:check

in the root directory of the Scala IDE to invoke Scalastyle.

Run the Scala IDE within Eclipse
--------------------------------

So, you managed to have the Scala IDE sources compiling, now it's time to learn how to run the Scala
IDE within Eclipse.

Doing this is especially useful if you need to do some manual debugging of the plug-in. Since the
Scala IDE uses weaving, you need to launch the IDE with weaving enabled, which is not configurable
in the vanilla launcher.

That is why we suggest you to install the
`Equinox Weaving Launcher <https://github.com/milessabin/equinox-weaving-launcher>`_.


.. _setup_install-equinox-weaving-launcher:

Install the Equinox Weaving Launcher
....................................

To install the Equinox Weaving Launcher, use the following Eclipse update site:

        http://download.scala-ide.org/plugins/equinox-weaving-launcher/releases/site/

This adds two more launch configurations: Eclipse Application with Equinox Weaving, and JUnit plug-in
test with Equinox Weaving.

Create a run configuration for launching Eclipse with Scala IDE
...............................................................

To create a run configuration, right click on the ``org.scala-ide.sdt.core`` project and select
Run As > Equinox Weaving enabled Eclipse Application.  That should fire up a second Eclipse instance.
To quickly test that all is working fine, try to create a Scala project.

You are now ready to hack on the Scala IDE. Start by looking around, do some change and observe what
happens when you launch the second Eclipse's instance.

Read the rest of the developer documentation to get more insights about the overall architecture.

Run the test suite inside Eclipse
---------------------------------

You can use the built-in JUnit runner to run or debug the tests inside Eclipse. As for the normal run,
you need to the *Equinox Weaving Launcher*. In the *Run Configuration* Dialog, create a new configuration
using the **JUnit Plug-In test with Equinox Weaving**. Make sure you selected the *org.scala-ide.sdt.core.tests*
project, and choose the test class you want to run (use ``org.scalaide.TestsSuite`` to run all tests).

In the **Main** tab make the following adjustments:

* Choose **Run an application: [No Application] - Headless Mode**.

The window should look like this:

.. image:: images/setup.png

In the **Arguments** tab, make sure to add the following arguments to the VM arguments list:

.. code-block:: bash

   -Dsdtcore.headless -Dsdtcore.notimeouts

The first one tells the IDE to not try to open any windows or dialogs, while the second one disables
timeouts for certain actions (otherwise, on a slow or overloaded system, the tests might fail simply
because of a timeout).


Additional information
----------------------

``org.scala-ide.sdt.aspects`` project
.....................................

The Scala IDE plug-in uses AspectJ to weave into Eclipse and hook in to JDT internals. If you want to work
on JDT integration within the Scala IDE plug-in, then it is a good idea to import
``org.scala-ide.sdt.aspects`` project in your Eclipse workspace and also install the `AspectJ
Eclipse plug-in <http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt>`_.


Using JRebel
............

If you want to use JRebel, there are two things you need to know:

1. You can simply add ``-noverify -javaagent:path/to/javarebel.jar`` to the VM arguments in the
   run configuration. For Windows, this is
   ``-noverify "-javaagent:C:\Program Files (x86)\ZeroTurnaround\JRebel\jrebel.jar"``.
2. JRebel is free for Scala users, see Free JavaRebel for Scala users, ZeroTurnaround announces.
