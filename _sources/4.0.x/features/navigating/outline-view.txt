Outline View
============

The outline view of the standard Eclipse editors is also supported for the Scala IDE ! Hit ``Alt + Shift + Q, O`` to bring it up. You will be able to see eclarations for package, class, member, etc.

The outline view is also linked to your editor : clicking on members in the Outline view focuses your editor to the region of text where that element is declared. In a large file, this may be very useful.

A lighter version of the same feature is available if you press ``Ctrl + O`` (``Command + O`` on Mac) with the focus on the current editor.
