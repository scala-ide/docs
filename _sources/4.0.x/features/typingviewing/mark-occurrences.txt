As in the Java tooling, Mark Occurrences highlights within a file where a type, variable or method is referenced.

**This feature is disabled by default, as it can have an impact on the editor performance**, but it is really useful when exploring code. 

It can be enabled in the ``Scala -> Editor`` preference page, or using the button in the main toolbar.
