Indent Guide |new|
==================

The Scala editor supports showing an Indent Guide, which is disabled by default:

.. image:: images/indent-guide.png

It can be enabled in ``Preferences → Scala → Editor`` where also its color can be chosen:

Please note that the indentation span between two guides is specified by the ``Preferences → Scala → Formatter → Spaces to indent`` preference.
