Scala Scopes Building |new| (since 4.1)
=======================================

Scala IDE provides two different ways to build a project. The first and one takes all sources in a project and compiles them regardless where they are stored and what their output folders are. The second one breaks up the build process of a project into stages called scopes.

A Scope is a set of source files, which are compiled together and whose "product of compilation units" is stored in a specific output folder.

This feature has been designed to solve a problem of compiling macro code. Up to now macro code had to be moved to a separate project on which the main project depends on. With the Scala Scopes Builder macro code can be defined and used in the same project.

3 scopes are defined by convention:

- ``macros`` with the default source path: ``<project root>/src/macros*`` and especially for Play projects ``<project root>/conf*``
- ``tests`` with the default source path: ``<project root>/src/test*`` and (because of Play projects) ``<project root>/test*``
- ``main`` which gets all source paths that don't match macros and tests scopes
\ :sub:`(\* is just a wildcard so for example to tests scope are assigned sources from folders src/test, src/test-my-special)`

The scopes are compiled in order: ``macros``, ``main``, ``tests``. The compilation is conditional so if any compilation scope fails then further scopes are not compiled anymore. So when ``macros`` compilation fails then neither ``main`` nor ``tests`` are compiled. When ``macros`` compiles successfully and ``main`` fails then the ``tests`` scope is not compiled.

Of course the output folder of a particular scope is added to the classpath of the depending scopes. This means that the output of ``macros`` is added to ``main`` and ``tests`` classpaths and output of ``main`` is added to ``tests`` classpath.

Besides of scopes dependencies in a single project there are the dependencies defined across projects' scopes too. When some given project (for simplicity let's call it *B*) depends on another project (let's call it *A*) then the dependencies between
these two projects' scopes are determined in the following way:

- ``macros`` of *B* depends on ``macros`` and ``main`` of *A* (so ``macros`` of *B* requires a successful compilation of ``macros`` and ``main`` scopes in project *A*)
- ``main`` of *B* depends on ``macros`` and ``main`` of *A*
- ``tests`` of *B* depends on ``macros``, ``main`` and ``tests`` of *A*

Enabling scopes compilation
---------------------------

The feature is turned ``on`` by default. To suppress it go to the project properties: ``Right click on a project → Properties → Scala Compiler → Build manager`` and uncheck ``useScopesCompiler``. Clean your project afterwards.

Changing the settings for existing project
------------------------------------------

If project already exists you can change its configuration to get advantage of scopes compilation and resolve problems with dependent builds in the following way:

- Open project context menu and select path ``Right click on a project → Properties → Java Build Path → Source``.

- Check ``Allow output folders for source folders``.

- Edit ``Output folder`` of chosen source folder and set your output folder. Click *Ok*.

- Clean the project.
