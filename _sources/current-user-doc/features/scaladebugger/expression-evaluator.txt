Expression evaluator user documentation
=======================================

Scala debugger uses new expression evaluator, which translates user code into invocations of ``JDI`` remote calls. This
allows evaluation of expression in context of some breakpoint, with access to local variables and methods.

Expression evaluator adds separate view to Scala IDE (similar to ``Scala interpreter`` view). It also enables conditional breakpoints - breakpoints that are enabled only if some condition is met.

Evaluator view
--------------

To open evaluator view use ``Window → Show View → Other → Debug → Scala Expression Evaluator``. In there, any
expression can be evaluated in context of your current breakpoint. This allows usage any values and types visible
from breakpoint and (possibly) modification of state of your application.

``CTRL+ENTER`` evaluates expression. ``CTRL+Up`` and ``CTRL+Down`` browses expression history. Code completion can be
triggered with ``CTRL+Space`` (enabled in properties).

``Tree view`` part contains structure of result which can be traversed to inspect it further (see also
:ref:`logical-structures-support`).

.. note:: Evaluator view works only when using Scala debugger and on ``SUSPENDED`` threads.

It is also possible to immediately evaluate a selected text from the editor. One can do that using ``CTRL+SHIFT+K``
shortcut or the dedicated button. If there's no selected text, a whole line containing a cursor will be sent to the evaluator.

Configuring expression view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expression view can be configured to your liking. There are 5 pre-configured views to choose from:

Console
.......

Console and tree on bottom

Console and tree on right (default)

Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~

In context menu ``Text clear after evaluation`` and ``line numbers`` can be enabled/disabled:

More settings can be configured in preferences view (``Window → Preferences → Scala → Debug → Expression Evaluator``):

.. image:: images/expression-evaluator/preferences.png
   :alt: Expression evaluator preferences

Choosing frame on which to evaluate expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expressions can be evaluated on any (non-native) frame in current thread. Frames can be changed by simply clicking on
them in ``Debug`` view:

.. image:: images/expression-evaluator/choosing-frames.png
   :alt: Choosing frames to evaluate

Refreshing variables view after evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables view is refreshed after each evaluation to reflect (possible) changes in values shown. You can disable it in
preferences.

Conditional breakpoints
-----------------------

Expressions can be assigned to breakpoint as a condition. Such breakpoint will only stop if expression evaluates to
``true`` or if evaluation completes with error.

To convert standard breakpoint to conditional one enter ``Breakpoint properties`` either via context menu or
``CTRL + Double click`` shortcut:

.. image:: images/expression-evaluator/conditional-menu.png
   :alt: Access to breakpoint settings

In settings, enable ``conditional`` and type in expression.

.. note:: Condition must return ``Boolean``, otherwise an error will be issued.

.. note:: Currently only ``Suspend when 'true'`` is supported, ``Suspend when value changes`` is not.

Features and problems
---------------------

Scala is a language with a lot of features and not every feature is supported in expression evaluator right now.
The following should work fine:

* access to all values visible from breakpoint (both locally and globally) with exception of access modifiers (see known limitations),
* assignment to Scala ``var``\s,
* control structures: ``if/else``, ``while``, ``do/while`` and ``for`` comprehensions,
* both Java and Scala var-arg methods and Scala var-arg constructors,
* implicits,
* methods from ``this`` and ``super``,
* number, tuple, unit and ``null`` literals,
* creating new instances (those are created on debugged jvm),
* limited support for lambdas (you need to specify types of arguments sometimes),
* operations on ``Array``\s,
* access to Java fields and methods (both static and instance),
* assignment to Java fields,
* ``isInstanceOf`` and ``asInstanceOf``,
* named-parameters,
* and default values.

Expression evaluator depends on implementation details of Scala, JDI and JVM platform and not all Scala features are
supported yet. Known limitations includes:

* assignment to local variables (those inside methods) of type boxed Java primitive (eg: ``java.lang.Integer``),
* ``try/catch``,
* ``throw``,
* ``scala.Dynamic``,
* Java constructors with var-args (``ToolBox`` fails to compile those - see SI-9212_),
* relative imports (see SI-6393_),
* access to ``private`` and ``protected`` methods and fields,
* float literals (for some reason ``1.0f`` becomes ``1.0`` after parsing with ``ToolBox``),
* and probably more unknown to us.
